The instructions in this document will be followed in the situations below:

<ol type="A">
  <li>a new hire,</li>
  <li>a grant of rights, OR</li>
  <li>a user role change</li>

# Procedures

1. Check to see if an enterprise process for granting access to enterprise assets exists.

            <li>yes</li>
            <li>no</li>
        </ol>
2. If “a,” then check to see if the process includes, at a minimum, a way to grant access for the situations described under [Scope](link). For each element that is included, assign a value of 1. Add the values of the elements included.
    <ol type="a">
            <li>value >0</li>
            <li>value <0</li>
        </ol>


# Outcomes

1. If [Procedure 1](link), then:
    <ol type="a">
            <li>outcome “a” means “pass”</li>
            <li>outcome “b” means “fail”</li>
        </ol>

2. If [Procedure 2](link) then:
