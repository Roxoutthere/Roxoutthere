# *About me*


## **Bio**
I was born and raised in Romania. I came to the US for grad school, and obtained 4 graduate degrees. I have a Master's in Writing, a Master's of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, and MBA, and a PhD in English. I am passionate about writing in all kinds of genres and for all audiences. I love and appreciate thorough research that eliminates bias. I spent most of my adult life in academia, professoring. But I also worked in nonprofit and local government. I've also done a fair share of freelance writing. I am a bit of a unicorn, if you will. You can find about more about me on my [website](https://roxanalcazan.weebly.com "roxanalcazan").
